## **Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup Design:**
Identifying design properties from a mockup design is fundamental for several reasons:

- Ensuring Visual Consistency: By extracting exact color codes, font families, weights, and sizes, developers can ensure that the implemented user interface precisely matches the designer's vision. This consistency builds trust and a professional image for the application.
- Facilitating Collaboration: Design specifications act as a common language between designers and developers. Everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of the visual requirements, minimizing miscommunication.
- Improving User Experience (UX): Precise implementation of design elements contributes directly to the overall user experience. Correct typography ensures readability, and accurate color usage reinforces brand identity and guides user attention effectively.
- Accessibility: Adhering to specified font sizes, color contrasts (which derive from identified color codes), and visual hierarchies directly supports WCAG guidelines, making the application accessible to a wider audience.
